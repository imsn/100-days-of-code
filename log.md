# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 3, 2017
##### (start it)

**Today's Progress**: working on basic componets (checkbox, datepicker).

**Thoughts:** Working on DatePicker and also Validator. Now they are in good shape. Also make form controls easier to handle.

### Day 1: March 4, 2017
##### (party day)

**Today's Progress**: Don't work and just party :)

**Thoughts:** Hangover... 

**Link to work:** Are you sure?

### Day 2: March 5, 2017
##### Work instead of two days

**Today's Progress**: RadioButtons, list and dropdown

**Thoughts:** Radio buttons and drop down are now in good shape, but List need more work for multiselect

### Day 3: March 6, 2017
##### Try to organize, failed

**Today's Progress**: Listbox and drop down finish

**Thoughts:** Now I have dropdown and list box which are just overlay over options component. Also textbox is overlay over
 FormControl. I try to create emailbox. But it failed in integrating with validator
